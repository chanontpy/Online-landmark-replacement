# Online-landmark-replacement

- This repository provides the code for the article "Online landmark replacement for out-of-sample dimensionality reduction methods" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12646).

- The main file is S-curve_landmark_replacement_embedding.py which contains landmark replacement algorithm (Algorithm 2) and the two diemensional embedding of S-curve data. The S-curve data set is artificial and is provided by 'sklearn' package. Note that one needs to import two assisting .py files: LandmarkMDS.py and Online_LandmarkReplacement_Functions.py.
